# SneakyApexScoreBot
Example of using [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js#tesseractjs), aka Optical Character Recognition, which is compiled to JS via [emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten), to read data from screenshots of Apex Legends score summary screens.  
  
I was inspired to make this for a few reasons: 
 1) This consumes a significant amount of time & manpower during events, and waiting for people to count sucks both as a participant and a viewer on TTV
 2) These people often count the results incorrectly
 3) Unfortuately children have been doctoring or submitting old screen shots to lie & win what they don't deserve
 4) Once it can scan VODs, it will allow for participants of any apex tournament to independently account for everyone's results, to make sure the play is damn good on both sides. 

Even if it's never 100% Accurate, it is capable of providing "confidence scores", so that anything it is unsure of can be presented as a batch for humans to review and fix. 

## It contains 3 examples
- The 1st is a small initial test, in which I clipped the header/value of one field out of the image and applied Tesseract to it
- The 2nd is closer to how I would like things to eventually function, where the areas of interest are clipped from a whole screenshot, and read individually
- The 3rd is showing you the raw bounding boxes of areas Tesseract thinks is text, demonstrating the necessity to spoonfeed it smaller images

## What Am I Going To Do With This?
- Probably make it work better
- [Check issues](https://github.com/sneakyness/SneakyApexScoreBot/issues)

## Other potential uses
- Discord Bot for Tournament Scorekeeping
    - Would also have to start verifying badges 
- VOD statistics compilation
    - Using ffmpeg, rapidly parse out every stat summary screen from a given video
    - Tally them up to generate session totals
- Killfeed sniper 
    - An app that either watches your stream or watches the screenshots directory
    - Any time you see a name in the kill feed that looks like a TTV streamer, you'd take a screenshot (or the stream bot would do so automatically)
    - It would parse the names out of the feed, search twitch for them, and play an alert tone if live

## Support
Unfortunately I am likely too busy playing Apex to offer free technical support. That said, I would be more than willing to accept subscriptions, donations, or bits on my [Twitch.tv stream](https://twitch.tv/sneakyness), preferably while live, in order to assist you.  

Hit me with a /w sneakyness on twitch, or ping me in the [official apex discord](https://discord.gg/apexlegends) (VLC#9200) to figure out how much help you'll need, and what it will cost. 

Do NOT use the issues tab as a place to submit your issues with using the software, technical support requests will be deleted. It is for issues with the codebase itself, thanks.

## Contributing
Pull requests welcome! I don't really care if it's ugly, as long as it works. We can make it nice later, saves us something to do should Apex/Origin go down üòè

## Licensing 
No idea, haven't looked at Tesserract's license yet.
